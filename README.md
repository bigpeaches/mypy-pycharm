This plugin provides both real-time and on-demand scanning of Python files with Mypy from within PyCharm/IDEA.

Mypy is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells 
(as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).

## Installation steps

The plugin requires [mypy](https://github.com/PyCQA/mypy) to be installed.

1. Download the latest [mypy-plugin-0.7.0.zip](https://github.com/leinardi/mypy-pycharm/releases)
2. In PyCharm go to Settings... -> Plugins -> Install plugins from disc
   -> Select downloaded file -> Restart PyCharm when prompted.

## Configuration

The only configuration needed is to set the path to Mypy executable, and only if is not already
inside the PATH environment variable.

To reach the Plugin configuration screen you can go to Settings... -> Other Settings -> Mypy
or simply click the gear icon from the side bar of the Mypy tool window.

To change the path to your Mypy executable you can either type the path directly or use 
the Browse button to open a file selection dialog.

Once you changed the path you should press the Test button to check if the plugin is able to run
the executable.

### Inspection severity

By default, Mypy message severity is set to Warning. It is possible to change the severity level
by going to Settings... -> Editor -> Inspections -> Mypy -> Severity:
